# 👋 Hi, I’m @MatheusTodao 🇺🇸
### And I love programming ❤️!

I discoveried programming world when I'm 12 year old (november or december of 2017), I wanted to know how I could built a android game and without to study programming!
<br />
Yeah! I know that sounds like CRAZY 😂!
<br />

In begin 2018 I started to study really programming, first I studied logical flow of code with visualG, like pascal but in the Portuguese; some months later I got my first steps to learn a language programming, it was a our little _Python_ 🐍.
<br />
Oh! I almost forgeting I tried to learn Java, but... 🙅‍♂️

In 2019 I found my language programming 😂 ❤️ and I not stop to learn it. It's ***Javascript***! A thing that motivate me, to learn its, was Omnistack of Rocketseat (7 days of coding a application) I loved (and I'm still loving) was the javascript stack: ***ReactJS, React Native and NodeJS***. When I saw concepts that give the possibility to write code in frontend and backend using same language I was without react! And same year I started to search How I can learn javascript and saw I had to study html and css, I tagged along.
<br />
<br />
Even I studying so much Javascript and React I can't see my growth, so I'm got at the end of 2020 great investment I join as student of course [JStack](https://jstack.com.br), for me this it have been good choice, because I can see what it was left to my grow up and I have learn so much with course and professor its.

* 💡 Fun Fact: I like to build UI/UX, I like to study about finance, I started read a book of Seneca (philosopher), I'm learner English and many more 😅.
